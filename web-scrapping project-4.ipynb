In May 2014, \"Gangnam Style\" became the first video to exceed two billion views.[27] \"Despacito\" became the first video to reach three billion views in August 2017,[7] four billion in October 2017,[8] five billion in April 2018,[9] six billion in February 2019,[10] and seven billion in October 2020.[11] \"Baby Shark Dance\" became the first video to reach eight billion views in February 2021, nine billion views in July 2021, and ten billion views in January 2022.[4]\\nAs of November 2020, sixteen videos have exceeded three billion views, seven of which exceed four billion views, three of which exceed five billion views, and two of which exceed six and seven billion views. \"See You Again\" became the second video to reach three billion views in August 2017,[18] followed by \"Gangnam Style\" in November 2017.[28] \"Shape of You\" became the second video to reach four billion views in January 2019,[14] followed by \"See You Again\" in February 2019.[19] \"Baby Shark Dance\" became the second video to reach five billion views in April 2020,[55] followed by \"Shape of You\" in October 2020. \"Baby Shark Dance\" became the second video to reach six billion views in July 2020, and seven billion views in October 2020.\\nThe majority of these videos in the Billion-View Club have been commercial music videos by popular artists, but the list has included oddities, typically programs aimed at children. Such videos include two episodes of the Russian animated cartoon Masha and the Bear, a version of \"The Wheels on the Bus\" by the British animation studio Little Baby Bum, and \"Johny Johny Yes Papa\" from children\\'s stations LooLoo Kids and ChuChu TV.[56] Various versions of the song \"Baby Shark\" in total amassed more than five billion views by January 2019, with the original version posted by Pinkfong having exceeded two billion views previously.[57] The original video by Pinkfong is now the most viewed video on the site. On October 29, 2020, Baby Shark surpassed 7 billion views, and on November 2, 2020, it passed Despacito to become the most viewed video on YouTube. On February 23, 2021, Baby Shark surpassed 8 billion views, becoming the first (and so far only) video to do so. On July 20, 2021, Baby Shark surpassed 9 billion views, becoming the first (and currently only) video to do so. On January 13, 2022, Baby Shark became the first (and currently only) video to surpass 10 billion views.[4]\\nOn July 14, 2022, YouTube made a special playlist and video celebrating the 317 music videos to have hit 1 billion views and joined the \"Billion Views Club\". Neither the playlist or video mention the numerous other videos to have joined the club nor Baby Shark, the most viewed video on the entire platform, which is, technically speaking, a music video.[58][59]\\nHistorical most-viewed videos\\nThe following table lists the videos that became YouTube\\'s most-viewed video, from April 2005 to the present.\\n  Current record (⁂)\\n  Former record (*)\\n  Indicates the video has since been removed or privatized from YouTube (‡)\\nProgression of the most-viewed video on YouTube\\nVideo name Uploader Views at\\nachievement* Publication date Date achieved Days after\\nupload Days\\nheld Takedown\\ndate Ref Notes\\n\"Baby Shark Dance\"[3] Pinkfong Baby Shark - Kids\\' Songs & Stories 7,046,700,000 June 17, 2016 November 2, 2020 1600 675\\n\"Despacito\"[6] Luis Fonsi 3,002,800,000 January 12, 2017 August 4, 2017 206 1,186 [60] [B]\\n\"See You Again\"[15] Wiz Khalifa 2,894,000,000 April 6, 2015 July 10, 2017 826 25 [16]\\n\"Gangnam Style\"⁂[24] Psy 803,700,000 July 15, 2012 November 24, 2012 134 1,689 [25] [J]\\n\"Baby\"*[61] Justin Bieber 245,400,000 February 19, 2010 July 16, 2010 149 862 [62] [L]\\n\"Bad Romance\"[65] Lady Gaga 178,400,000 November 24, 2009 April 14, 2010 143 93 [66] [M]\\n\"Charlie Bit My Finger\"‡[69] HDCYT 128,900,000 May 22, 2007 October 25, 2009 887 171 late July 2021[70] [71]\\n\"Evolution of Dance\"[72] Judson Laipply 118,900,000 April 6, 2006 May 2, 2009 1062 176 [73]\\n\"Girlfriend\"‡[74][75] RCA Records 92,600,000 February 27, 2007 July 17, 2008 508 289 no data [76] [N]\\n\"Evolution of Dance\"[72] Judson Laipply 78,400,000 April 6, 2006 March 15, 2008 651 124 [78]\\n\"Music Is My Hot Hot Sex\"‡[79] CLARUSBARTEL72 76,600,000 April 9, 2007 March 1, 2008 327 14 mid-2008[80] [81] [O]\\n\"Evolution of Dance\"*[72] Judson Laipply 10,600,000 April 6, 2006 May 19, 2006 16 652 [84] [P]\\n\"Pokemon Theme Music Video\"‡[85] Smosh 4,300,000 November 28, 2005 March 12, 2006 105 68 June 2007[86] [87] [Q]\\n\"Myspace – The Movie\"‡[90][91] eggtea 2,700,000 January 31, 2006 February 18, 2006 18 22 mid-2006[92] [93]\\n\"Phony Photo Booth\"‡[94] mugenized 3,400,000 December 1, 2005 January 21, 2006 50 28 no data [95] [R]\\n\"The Chronic of Narnia Rap\"‡[96] youtubedude 2,300,000 December 18, 2005 January 9, 2006 22 12 no data [97]\\n\"Ronaldinho: Touch of Gold\"‡*[98] Nikesoccer 255,000 October 21, 2005 October 31, 2005 10 70 no data [99] [S]\\n\"I/O Brush\"‡*[101] larfus 247,000 October 5, 2005 October 29, 2005 24 2 no data [102]\\n\"Me at the zoo\"[103] jawed 1 April 23, 2005 April 23, 2005 0 189 [104]\\nAs of September 8, 2022\\n* The approximate number of views each video had when it became YouTube\\'s most-viewed video.\\nTimeline of most viewed videos (Oct 2005 – Jun 2022)\\nNo. 1 most viewed video (Oct 2005 – Jun 2006)\\nNo. 1 most viewed video (Apr 2006 – Jan 2010)\\nNo. 1 most viewed video (Oct 2009 – Jan 2013)\\nNo. 1 most viewed video (Jan 2012 – Jun 2022)\\nOther milestones\\nYouTube announced that cumulative views of videos related to Minecraft, some of which had been on the service as early as 2009, exceeded 1 trillion views on December 14, 2021, and was the most-watched video game content on the site.[105]\\nSee also\\nList of most-disliked YouTube videos\\nList of most-liked YouTube videos\\nList of most-subscribed YouTube channels\\nList of most-viewed YouTube channels\\nList of most-viewed online videos in the first 24 hours\\nList of most-viewed online trailers in the first 24 hours\\nList of viral music videos\\nList of most-streamed songs on Spotify\\nNotes\\n^ \"Baby Shark Dance\" was the fifth video to reach 4 billion views on November 25, 2019; second video to reach 5 billion views on April 3, 2020; second video to reach 6 billion views on July 16, 2020; second video to reach 7 billion views on October 29, 2020; first video to reach 8 billion views on February 23, 2021; the first video to reach 9 billion views on July 20, 2021; first video to reach 10 billion views on January 13, 2022;[4] and the first video to reach 11 billion views on July 24, 2022.

       "['What is Selenium?\\nSelenium is a free (open-source) automated testing framework used to validate web applications across different browsers and platforms. You can use multiple programming languages like Java, C#, Python etc to create Selenium Test Scripts. Testing done using the Selenium testing tool is usually referred to as Selenium Testing.\\nSelenium Software is not just a single tool but a suite of software, each piece catering to different Selenium QA testing needs of an organization. Here is the list of tools\\nSelenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\\nSelenium Remote Control (RC)\\nWebDriver\\nSelenium Grid\\nIntroduction to Selenium\\nAt the moment, Selenium RC and WebDriver are merged into a single framework to form Selenium 2. Selenium 1, by the way, refers to Selenium RC. \\nClick here if the video is not accessible\\nIn this tutorial, you will learn:\\nWhat is Selenium?\\nWho developed Selenium?\\nThe Same Origin Policy Issue\\nBirth of Selenium Remote Control (Selenium RC)\\nBirth of Selenium Grid\\nBirth of Selenium IDE\\nBirth of WebDriver\\nBirth of Selenium 2\\nSo, Why the Name Selenium?\\nBrief Introduction Selenium IDE\\nBrief Introduction Selenium Remote Control (Selenium RC)\\nBrief Introduction WebDriver\\nSelenium Grid\\nNote on Browser and Environment Support\\nHow to Choose the Right Selenium Tool for Your Need\\nA Comparison between Selenium and QTP(now UFT)\\nAdvantages of QTP over Selenium\\nWho developed Selenium?\\nSince Selenium is a collection of different tools, it had different developers as well. Below are the key persons who made notable contributions to the Selenium Project\\nPrimarily, Selenium was created by Jason Huggins in 2004. An engineer at ThoughtWorks, he was working on a web application that required frequent testing. Having realized that the repetitious Manual Testing of their application was becoming more and more inefficient, he created a JavaScript program that would automatically control the browser’s actions. He named this program as the “JavaScriptTestRunner.”\\nSeeing potential in this idea to help automate other web applications, he made JavaScriptRunner open-source which was later re-named as Selenium Core.\\nThe Same Origin Policy Issue\\nSame Origin policy prohibits JavaScript code from accessing elements from a domain that is different from where it was launched. Example, the HTML code in www.google.com uses a JavaScript program “randomScript.js”. The same origin policy will only allow randomScript.js to access pages within google.com such as google.com/mail, google.com/login, or google.com/signup. However, it cannot access pages from different sites such as yahoo.com/search or guru99.com because they belong to different domains.\\n\\nThis is the reason why prior to Selenium RC, testers needed to install local copies of both Selenium Core (a JavaScript program) and the web server containing the web application being tested so they would belong to the same domain\\nBirth of Selenium Remote Control (Selenium RC)\\nUnfortunately; testers using Selenium Core had to install the whole application under test and the web server on their own local computers because of the restrictions imposed by the same origin policy. So another ThoughtWork’s engineer, Paul Hammant, decided to create a server that will act as an HTTP proxy to “trick” the browser into believing that Selenium Core and the web application being tested come from the same domain. This system became known as the Selenium Remote Control or Selenium 1.\\nBirth of Selenium Grid\\nSelenium Grid was developed by Patrick Lightbody to address the need of minimizing test execution times as much as possible. He initially called the system “Hosted QA.” It was capable of capturing browser screenshots during significant stages, and also of sending out Selenium commands to different machines simultaneously.\\nBirth of Selenium IDE\\nShinya Kasatani of Japan created Selenium IDE, a Firefox extension that can automate the browser through a record-and-playback feature. He came up with this idea to further increase the speed in creating test cases. He donated Selenium IDE to the Selenium Project in 2006.\\nBirth of WebDriver\\nSimon Stewart created WebDriver circa 2006 when browsers and web applications were becoming more powerful and more restrictive with JavaScript programs like Selenium Core. It was the first cross-platform testing framework that could control the browser from the OS level.\\n  Birth of Selenium 2\\nIn 2008, the whole Selenium Team decided to merge WebDriver and Selenium RC to form a more powerful tool called Selenium 2, with WebDriver being the core. Currently, Selenium RC is still being developed but only in maintenance mode. Most of the Selenium Project’s efforts are now focused on Selenium 2.\\nSo, Why the Name Selenium?\\nThe Name Selenium came from a joke which Jason cracked once to his team. During Selenium’s development, another automated testing framework was popular made by the company called Mercury Interactive (yes, the company who originally made QTP before it was acquired by HP). Since Selenium is a well-known antidote for Mercury poisoning, Jason suggested that name and his teammates took it. So that is how we got to call this framework up to the present.\\nBrief Introduction Selenium IDE\\nSelenium Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is the simplest framework in the Selenium suite and is the easiest one to learn. It is a Firefox plugin that you can install as easily as you can with other plugins. However, because of its simplicity, Selenium IDE should only be used as a prototyping tool. If you want to create more advanced test cases, you will need to use either Selenium RC or WebDriver.\\n  Brief Introduction Selenium Remote Control (Selenium RC)\\nSelenium RC was the flagship testing framework of the whole Selenium project for a long time. This is the first automated web testing tool that allowed users to use a programming language they prefer. As of version 2.25.0, RC can support the following programming languages:\\nJava\\nC#\\nPHP\\nPython\\nPerl\\nRuby\\nBrief Introduction WebDriver\\nThe WebDriver proves itself to be better than both Selenium IDE and Selenium RC in many aspects. It implements a more modern and stable approach in automating the browser’s actions. WebDriver, unlike Selenium RC, does not rely on JavaScript for Selenium Automation Testing. It controls the browser by directly communicating with it.\\nThe supported languages are the same as those in Selenium RC.\\nJava\\nC#\\nPHP\\nPython\\nPerl\\nRuby\\nSelenium Grid\\nSelenium Grid is a tool used together with Selenium RC to run parallel tests across different machines and different browsers all at the same time. Parallel execution means running multiple tests at once.\\nFeatures:\\nEnables simultaneous running of tests in multiple browsers and environments.\\nSaves time enormously.\\nUtilizes the hub-and-nodes concept. The hub acts as a central source of Selenium commands to each node connected to it.\\nNote on Browser and Environment Support\\nBecause of their architectural differences, Selenium IDE, Selenium RC, and WebDriver support different sets of browsers and operating environments.\\nSelenium IDE WebDriver\\nBrowser Support Mozilla Firefox Internet Explorer versions 6 to 11, both 32 and 64-bit\\nMicrosoft Edge version 12.10240 & above ( partial support some functionalities under development)\\nFirefox 3.0 and above\\nGoogle Chrome 12.0. and above\\nOpera 11.5 and above\\nAndroid – 2.3 and above for phones and tablets (devices & emulators)\\niOS 3+ for phones (devices & emulators) and 3.2+ for tablets (devices & emulators)\\nHtmlUnit 2.9 and above\\nOperating System Windows, Mac OS X, Linux All operating systems where the browsers above can run.\\nNote: Selenium WebDriver is termed as the successor of Selenium RC which has been deprecated & officially announced by SeleniumHQ.\\nHow to Choose the Right Selenium Tool for Your Need\\nTool Why Choose?\\nSelenium IDE\\nTo learn about concepts on automated testing and Selenium, including:\\nSelenese commands such as type, open, clickAndWait, assert, verify, etc.\\nLocators such as id, name, xpath, css selector, etc.\\nExecuting customized JavaScript code using runScript\\nExporting test cases in various formats.\\nTo create tests with little or no prior knowledge in programming.\\nTo create simple test cases and test suites that you can export later to RC or WebDriver.\\nTo test a web application against Firefox and Chrome only.\\nSelenium RC\\nTo design a test using a more expressive language than Selenese\\nTo run your test against different browsers (except HtmlUnit) on different operating systems.\\nTo deploy your tests across multiple environments using Selenium Grid.\\nTo test your application against a new browser that supports JavaScript.\\nTo test web applications with complex AJAX-based scenarios.\\nWebDriver\\nTo use a certain programming language in designing your test case.\\nTo test applications that are rich in AJAX-based functionalities.\\nTo execute tests on the HtmlUnit browser.\\nTo create customized test results.\\nSelenium Grid\\nTo run your Selenium RC scripts in multiple browsers and operating systems simultaneously.\\nTo run a huge test suite, that needs to complete in the soonest time possible.\\nA Comparison between Selenium and QTP(now UFT)\\nQuick Test Professional(QTP) is a proprietary automated testing tool previously owned by the company Mercury Interactive before it was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 2006. The Selenium Tool Suite has many advantages over  QTP as detailed below –\\nAdvantages and Benefits of Selenium over QTP\\nSelenium QTP\\nOpen source, free to use, and free of charge. Commercial.\\nHighly extensible Limited add-ons\\nCan run tests across different browsers Can only run tests in Firefox, Internet Explorer and Chrome\\nSupports various operating systems Can only be used in Windows\\nSupports mobile devices QTP Supports Mobile app test automation (iOS & Android) using HP solution called – HP Mobile Center\\nCan execute tests while the browser is minimized Needs to have the application under test to be visible on the desktop\\nCan execute tests in parallel. Can only execute in parallel but using Quality Center which is again a paid product.\\nAdvantages of QTP over Selenium\\nAdvantages of QTP over Selenium\\nQTP Selenium\\nCan test both web and desktop applications Can only test web applications\\nComes with a built-in object repository Has no built-in object repository\\nAutomates faster than Selenium because it is a fully featured IDE. Automates at a slower rate because it does not have a native IDE and only third party IDE can be used for development\\nData-driven testing is easier to perform because it has built-in global and local data tables. Data-driven testing is more cumbersome since you have to rely on the programming language’s capabilities for setting values for your test data\\nCan access controls within the browser(such as the Favorites bar, Address bar, Back and Forward buttons, etc.) Cannot access elements outside of the web application under test\\nProvides professional customer support No official user support is being offered.\\nHas native capability to export test data into external formats Has no native capability to export runtime data onto external formats\\nParameterization Support is built Parameterization can be done via programming but is difficult to implement.\\nTest Reports are generated automatically No native support to generate test /bug reports.\\nThough clearly, QTP has more advanced capabilities, Selenium outweighs QTP in three main areas:\\nCost(because Selenium is completely free)\\nFlexibility(because of a number of programming languages, browsers, and platforms it can support)\\nParallel testing(something that QTP is capable of but only with use of Quality Center)\\nSummary\\nThe entire Selenium Software Testing Suite is comprised of four components:\\nSelenium IDE, a Firefox add-on that you can only use in creating relatively simple test cases and test suites.\\nSelenium Remote Control, also known as Selenium 1, which is the first Selenium tool that allowed users to use programming languages in creating complex tests.\\nWebDriver, the newer breakthrough that allows your test scripts to communicate directly to the browser, thereby controlling it from the OS level.\\nSelenium Grid is also a tool that is used with Selenium RC to execute parallel tests across different browsers and operating systems.\\nSelenium RC and WebDriver was merged to form Selenium 2.\\nSelenium is more advantageous than QTP in terms of costs and flexibility. It also allows you to run tests in parallel, unlike in QTP where you are only allowed to run tests sequentially.\\nYou Might Like:\\nPage Object Model (POM) & Page Factory in Selenium\\nSelenium Wait – Implicit, Explicit and Fluent Waits\\nHow to Select Value from DropDown using Selenium Webdriver\\nSelenium C# Webdriver Tutorial: NUnit Example\\nFind Element and FindElements by XPath in Selenium WebDriver']"
